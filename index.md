# Welcome

Thank you for visiting my Computer Science capstone e-portfolio. This site presents a concise record of my work and growth during the program. You can read my professional self-assessment, review one artifact in its original and enhanced forms, see the narratives for the three required categories, and find my code review video link.

Use the links in the header to navigate, or start here:

- **Professional Self-Assessment / Education Review** → [read it]({{ site.baseurl }}/self-assessment/)
- **Capstone Artifact** (Original & Enhanced) → [view it]({{ site.baseurl }}/artifact/)
- **Narratives** (Software Engineering & Design, Algorithms & Data Structures, Databases) → [read them]({{ site.baseurl }}/narratives/)
- **Code Review Video** → [link/placeholder]({{ site.baseurl }}/code-review/)

If you are an evaluator, you can jump directly to the enhanced artifact or the narratives. All pages are kept brief and focused for quick review.
