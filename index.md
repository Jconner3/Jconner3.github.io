## Welcome {:#welcome}
Welcome to my capstone e-portfolio for Southern New Hampshire University’s(SNHU) Computer Science program. This single page completes CS-499 and the remaining requirements for my B.S. in Computer Science. My goal was simple,  to demonstrate sound engineering practice and explain decisions in plain technical language while providing evidence of progress from coursework to capstone.
