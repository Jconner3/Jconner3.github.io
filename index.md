## Welcome {:#welcome}
Welcome to my capstone e-portfolio for Southern New Hampshire University’s(SNHU) Computer Science program. This single page completes CS-499 and the remaining requirements for my B.S. in Computer Science. My goal was simple,  to demonstrate sound engineering practice and explain decisions in plain technical language while providing evidence of progress from coursework to capstone.

## Professional Self-Assessment {:#self}
I started the Computer Science program in February 2023, so I have been in the program for about two and a half years. Before this degree, I studied biology at Angelo State University for two years. I originally planned on medical school, but I ultimately decided my interest in science and medicine was rooted in the knowledge and understanding, not so much from practicing medicine. My path into computer science was not a straight line, but I think that ended up helping me in the long run. Being a biology major taught me how to observe, document, and explain processes clearly and the transition to computer science taught me how to build those processes into working systems.

During the program I developed three core skills that changed how I work with the first being self-guided learning and research. Modern development work expects you to solve problems that are not already solved for you. I very quickly had to learn how to analyze documentation that didn’t explicitly tell me how to accomplish a task, test small ideas quickly, and then correct my own approach when I discovered a better pattern. I successfully improved my structured problem-solving skills and learned how to break a large task into smaller ones, define the requirements, design the logic and then implement that logic in a controlled way instead of constant guessing and patching. Something that I have always struggled with and made it a point to improve is my time management skills. Most courses over the years involved parallel work and it was important that I kept long term deadlines in mind while still delivering working code in short cycles. All three of these skills together made me more reliable and more confident when I work on a project with real expectations.
