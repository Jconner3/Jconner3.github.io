## <ins>Category One: Software Engineering & Design</ins>

My enhancements for the Software Engineering & Design category focused on how the app feels and behaves when a real person is using it. The goal was to take something functional and raise it to the level of something that respects flow, and usability. One major change was the redesign of the Progress screen. I introduced a dedicated Monthly Averages section with a clear title and rows the user can actually read at a glance. I also added visible controls to filter by timeframe and change sort order. Instead of forcing the user to scroll through everything and interpret it themselves, the app now gives them a way to view recent progress or historical progress in a controlled, intentional way.

I also reworked the list of logged entries so it’s easier to navigate. The app now inserts headers that mark each month which breaks the history into understandable sections instead of one long wall of numbers. From a design point of view, that helps the user notice patterns in their progress over time. From an engineering point of view, that required changes to how the list is built and rendered on screen so that headers show up at the right moment without glitching or repeating.

I put a lot of work into how the user edits and manages existing entries. Originally, each row had its own set of action icons, which felt crowded and busy. I replaced those icons with a long-press menu that opens options like editing the date, editing the weight, or deleting the entry. I also added the ability to tap the weight value directly and update it through an edit dialog, which keeps the adjustment focused and prevents the user from hunting through multiple screens. Deleting an entry now asks for confirmation and shows an undo Snackbar afterward, so a mistake can be reversed instead of being permanent. I fixed layout padding so the last row in a list doesn’t hide behind the bottom navigation bar, which was an issue once the number of logs hit about ten or so.

The Home screen also went through a full pass. I rebuilt it around a Material View style card with a progress indicator and a stats layout that shows the user’s current status in a stable, readable way. I added an empty state that appears when there are no logged entries yet. That state includes a direct “Log now” action, so the app gives direction instead of leaving the screen blank. Small details also mattered. To the Log Your Weight screen, I added a Today quick action and support for saving from the keyboard’s Done button in the logging screen, because reducing friction during input makes the app feel intentional rather than unfinished. The app also keeps the goal-reached SMS trigger in the flow, which shows how notification-style behavior can be tied to preferences and user permission.

Every visual change required additional thought into what other parts of the code would be impacted by adding the functionality. Adding the month headers meant changing how the list is built. Adding undo meant creating a safe recovery path after destructive actions. Redesigning the Home screen meant deciding what information deserves to be surfaced and what can stay in supporting views. I had to think about edge cases such as first-time use, accidental deletes, partial input, and long histories

Through all of my enhancments I accomplished the following course outcomes: 
I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by rebuilding the data layer of the app so it behaves like part of a real product instead of a basic class project. I standardized how entries are stored and retrieved, created focused query methods that return exactly what the rest of the app needs, and added structure so the app can pull historical data in a clean and predictable way.

I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by moving the app to SQLCipher with full at-rest encryption, requiring a passphrase to open the database, and keeping that passphrase out of the code. I also treated each saved record as protected data and controlled how it could be inserted, accessed, and displayed.
